## How Cybercriminals Use AI to Power Their Attacks

Managing a business on your own is full of challenges. The day-to-day grind can be difficult enough on its own, but now you also need to consider cyber threats to your organization. There is cause for alarm as hackers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to launch sophisticated cyberattacks to steal your data and disrupt business operations.

The good news is there are steps you can take to protect your business. This article will explain how AI is being used in cybercrime and what you can do to safeguard your business.

## How hackers use AI

Here are some of the ways cybercriminals are exploiting AI:

**Deepfakes:** Hackers use AI to create highly realistic fake videos or audio recordings to impersonate someone you know, like your boss or a trusted friend. These deepfakes can be used to trick you into sending money or sharing sensitive information.

*How to spot it:* Closely look for details like unnatural facial movements or sloppy voice synchronization.

**AI-powered password cracking:** With the help of AI, cybercriminals can effortlessly crack common and easy passwords. Hackers with access to advanced computation offered by AI can automate the breaching process, which means they can try millions of combinations to guess your password.

*How to fight back:* Always use unique passwords. Consider using a password manager.

**AI-assisted hacking:** Hackers no longer need to spend hours looking for vulnerabilities. Instead, with the help of AI, they can create automated programs that not only identify weaknesses in your system but also create new types of malware.

*How to stay ahead:* Keep your security systems and software updated. Also, a mandate should be set up to scan for vulnerabilities routinely.

**Supply chain attacks:** Threat actors use AI to insert malicious code into legitimate vendor products, which eventually will compromise your system as well.

*How to protect yourself:* Only download software from trusted sources. Always be vigilant with updates and patches.
