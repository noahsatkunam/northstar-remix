## How to Stay Ahead of AI-Powered Cybersecurity Risks

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits for organizations, but it has also created new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit to carry out intricate cyberattacks that are difficult to detect and mitigate. Using AI, hackers can create convincing phishing emails that bypass spam filters. Cybercriminals can also leverage AI to manipulate security systems and gain unauthorized access. All of this can cause irreparable damage to your business and your reputation.

This evolving threat landscape can be tough for organizations that do not have a dedicated IT security team equipped with the necessary advanced tools to mitigate complex cybercrimes. Fortunately, there is a lot you can do to strengthen your organization's cybersecurity. Read on to explore ways to improve your preparedness against AI-powered cyberattacks.

## Security best practices for AI

Here are some practical tips for improving your organization's cybersecurity posture against emerging AI threats:

### 1. Provide continuous, real-time cybersecurity training for your team

AI technology is evolving faster than ever, and so are cyberthreats. Mix the two together without continuous cybersecurity training for your team, and you'll have a security disaster on your hands.

When a hacker targets an organization, an employee often gets blamed for clicking the wrong link or downloading an infected file. However, instead of blaming an individual, create a strategy to ensure all your employees have the knowledge and training they need to make the right decisions.

For example, you can use real-time scenarios or simulations to help your employees identify phishing emails so they don't fall for malicious attempts. You can even set up regular, ongoing security awareness training to educate your employees about persistent threats like ransomware and social engineering attacks. By making cybersecurity training an essential part of your work culture, you can have all your employees invested in organizational security.

### 2. Improve security policies and enforce them

As AI-powered cyberthreats evolve, take proactive steps to improve cybersecurity policies and strictly enforce them through consistent communication that emphasizes the need for good cyber hygiene. Your IT and HR teams can also work on cybersecurity strategies and policies that ensure your employees stay vigilant and aware of the latest AI cyberthreats. For example, you can have weekly newsletters sent out to employees to keep them updated on emerging threats.

Additionally, you can carry out regular risk assessments and implement multifactor authentication to enhance your cybersecurity. Businesses that don't have IT teams or security resources have been able to build a strong IT security stance with the help of a trusted IT service provider.

### 3. Partner with an IT service provider

An experienced IT service provider will have the inside scoop on all the latest developments in AI and can help you build a formidable cybersecurity posture that protects your business from AI-related threats. Since an IT service provider has the advanced resources and tools to combat threats, you can focus on crucial business decisions without having to worry about managing your IT security.
