## Key Considerations When Selecting the Right Cyber Insurance Coverage

Is your organization prepared to face today's growing cybersecurity threats?

Using the latest technologies is extremely important, but it's equally essential to ensure that your business has the best cyber liability insurance. Think of it as an invisible shield protecting your organization from devastating losses. However, to utilize its full potential and ensure robust protection, it is critical to have a nuanced understanding of it.

Read on to learn more about key things to consider when shopping for cyber liability insurance. But first, it's good to understand the difference between first-party coverage and third-party coverage:

## First-party coverage vs. third-party coverage

Every business today needs cyber liability insurance. To help businesses quickly respond and recover from data breaches, insurance providers have developed two types of cyber liability insurance: first-party coverage and third-party coverage.

Here's how they differ:

### 1. Focus of coverage

**First-party coverage:**
- Shields the insured business
- Protects against direct losses and expenses resulting from a data breach

**Third-party coverage:**
- Focuses on liabilities from third parties
- Covers claims made by third parties who suffered losses because of the insured business's cyber incident

### 2. Costs covered

**First-party coverage:**
- Covers only the insured's direct costs
- Pays for revenue loss, forensic investigations, data restoration, public relations, and customer notification services

**Third-party coverage:**
- Pays for businesses' legal expenses
- Covers cyber-related liabilities, such as data breaches, privacy violations, and defamation

### 3. Reputation management

**First-party coverage:**
- Pays for expenses related to hiring public relations firms
- Aims to restore the brand image of a business after a cyber incident

**Third-party coverage:**
- Primarily focused on handling the legal aspects
- More concerned with defending against claims and settling third-party disputes

### 4. Beneficiaries of coverage

**First-party coverage:**
- Directly benefits the insurer
- Provides direct protection to the insured party against direct losses

**Third-party coverage:**
- Benefits third parties, such as a business's customers, clients, and business partners
- Provides direct protection to those affected by a data breach suffered by the insured business

## Key things to consider while shopping for a policy

Here are some key points to consider when shopping for a cyber liability insurance policy:

**Coverage**

Comprehensive coverage is key to reducing the impact of a cyber incident. Your business can become the victim of a data breach or a large-scale cyberattack at any time. That's why it's crucial to ensure that the policy addresses cyber risks specific to your business.

**Limits**

Evaluate the policy to understand the coverage limits. The policy that you finalize should be able to handle the potential costs associated with a cyberattack, including legal fees, data recovery, and business interruption expenses.

**Exclusions**

Study the policy outlines to understand what is excluded. Any limitations in your policy can make your business vulnerable. That's why it's crucial to know what is not covered by your insurance.

**Incident response**

Make sure that the policy has provisions for developing and implementing a cyber incident response plan tailored to suit your business. Without a well-defined response plan, you won't be able to effectively respond to a cyber incident.

**Price**

Before finalizing a policy, compare and cross-check various policies, especially their costs and unique offerings. Although opting for the most affordable option can be tempting, it is crucial to ensure that the coverage you choose is best suited for your business needs.

**Reputation**

It is also important to do your due diligence and research the insurance company's reputation. Look for an insurer with a good reputation and positive customer feedback. Choose a company that settles claims promptly, as that is a reliable indicator of the level of support you can expect when you need it.
