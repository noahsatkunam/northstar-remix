## Cyber Insurance: A Safety Net - Not a Substitute - for Security

Cyber insurance is an invaluable tool in your risk management arsenal. Think of it as one of the many weapons you have against cyberthreats. However, there's a widespread misconception that having cyber insurance is enough. The truth is, without a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, your insurance can offer only limited protection.

In this article, we'll help you understand why cyber insurance should be seen as a safety net rather than a replacement for strong security.

## Understanding the limits of cyber insurance

In today's business landscape, cyber insurance is a must. However, having insurance doesn't guarantee a payout. Here are a few things that cyber insurance can't help you with:

**Business interruption:** Your cyber insurance policy can never fully cover the cost of lost productivity due to a cyberattack. The payouts, in most cases, would be partial and won't be enough for you to recover from the business interruption.

**Reputational damage:** Cyber insurance can't help you win back customer trust. It would take a lot of work to repair your organization's reputation.

**Evolving threats:** Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, and your insurance policy might not be able to offer a payout against new tactics.

**Social engineering attacks:** Cybercriminals often trick unsuspecting victims through social engineering attacks. If your business suffers losses due to a social engineering attack, like a phishing scam, you might not be covered.

**Insider threats:** Losses resulting from an internal risk are rarely covered by insurance providers. If the breach occurs because of a threat within your organization, your policy provider may not entertain the claim.

**Nation-state attacks:** Some rogue state nations deploy their hackers to carry out cyberattacks in other countries. Many insurance providers consider such attacks as acts of war and do not cover them.

## Six steps to build a strong cybersecurity posture

Implement these steps proactively to strengthen your defenses:

- Employee training is critical for building a strong defense against cyberthreats. Hold regular sessions and bootcamps to educate your team on cybersecurity best practices.
- Implement strong password policies. Using multi-factor authentication will phenomenally improve your internal security.
- Regularly back up your business-critical data. This will ensure you can bounce back quickly in case of a breach or a ransomware attack.
- Keep your software and security solutions up to date. Monitor and resolve issues before hackers have an opportunity to exploit them.
- Think of your network like your castle and do everything to protect it from hackers. Build a strong network security infrastructure complete with firewalls, anti-virus software, and threat detection systems.
